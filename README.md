Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments.

Vagrant provides the framework and configuration format to create and
manage complete portable development environments. These development
environments can live on your computer or in the cloud, and are portable
between Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

## Quick Start

First, make sure your development machine has [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)
installed. After this, [download and install the appropriate Vagrant package for your OS](http://downloads.vagrantup.com). If you're not on Mac OS X or Windows, you'll need
to add `/opt/vagrant/bin` to your `PATH`. After this, you're ready to go!

To build your first drupal virtual environment from scratch:

    git clone https://github.com/ksorokin/vagrant-drupal.git
    cd vagrant-drupal
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    vagrant up

## Vagrantfile

It is common to modify the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/ksorokin/vagrant-drupal/blob/master/Vagrantfile) to meet project needs. Read through the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as the [official documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/) for other possible configurations.
